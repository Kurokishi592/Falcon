# CP2106-Orbital-Falcon
A vision-based dynamic landing system for drones (UAVs) on moving platforms autonomously, using real-time AprilTag detection and comes with a GUI. Ideal for Raspberry Pi and compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows.

# FALCON Setup Instructions 
1. Download the Project
```bash
cd ~/Desktop
git clone https//github.com/Kurokishi592/Falcon.git
cd Falcon
```
Or alternatively, [download the ZIP file](https://github.com/Kurokishi592/Falcon/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), extract it, and move into under your local Desktop folder.

#### For üêß Linux/macOS/Raspberry Pi
If you don't have git, install it using your system's package manager (e.g., sudo apt install git on Raspberry Pi/Linux).

2. Run the following commands:
``` bash
chmod +x setup_and_run.sh
./setup_and_run.sh
```

#### For üíª Windows
Download Git Bash if you do not have it installed: https://git-scm.com/downloads, click on "Windows", run the Installer `.exe` file and leave settings at their default values.

2. Open Git Bash from the Start Menu

3. Go to the "Falcon" directory by running:
```bash
cd ~/desktop/Falcon
```

4. Run the following command to run Falcon:
```bash
./setup_and_run.sh
```

This will:
- Create a Python virtual environment
- Install all required packages
- Launch the GUI application

# FALCON Simple User Test
With the FALCON GUI opened, start the camera feed:
1. Under "Select Camera" dropdown options, select the camera that starts with '700', this should start your webcam. (Or any other usb camera you can use)

2. Open the pdf "recursive tag id 0 1 2" to test the apriltag detection using another device. As long as the tag is displayed on a separate screen any method will do. You can just open using your phone.

3. Display the tag in front of your webcam/camera and FALCON will reflect an overlay to show detection. 

- Ensure that the tag is fully displayed on your separate screen
- Zoom in on the pdf. The recursive tag, as the name suggests, has tags placed within tags
- It is robust to rotation of up to 80 degrees, and far or near, try it yourself

Done!
FALCON is now opened with a GUI and your selected camera feed. Feel free to play around with the other features too!

*Ignore the stuff below*

# Installation Instructions
The [GUI](https://github.com/Kurokishi592/Falcon/blob/main/Frontend/Tkinter/tkinter_main.py) relies on Python's Tkinter dependency. Tkinter comes preinstalled with any [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version.

Other dependencies include:
1. [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) 

OpenCV is used for interfacing with camera. It can be installed with the following bash command:
```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

2. [cv2-enumerate-cameras](https://pypi.org/project/cv2-enumerate-cameras/)

cv2-enumerate-cameras is used for listing all the cameras present on the system. It can be installed with the following bash command:
```bash
pip install cv2-enumerate-cameras
```

3. [pupil-apriltags](https://pypi.org/project/pupil-apriltags/)
pupil-apriltags is used for the AprilTag detection.
```bash
pip install pupil-apriltags
```

# Runtime Instructions
To run the GUI, run the frontend Python file. This can be done through the terminal, after navigating to the folder that the file is located in:
```bash
python tkinter_main.py
```

Otherwise, ```tkinter_main.exe``` [(link (Deprecated for now))]() can be run. However, as the application has not been signed by any antivirus companies, the active antivirus (Windows Defender or otherwise) is likely to produce a [malware warning](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62095008/i-am-not-allowed-to-run-a-python-executable-on-other-pcs). If using Windows Defender, press on the ```More info``` button, and then the ```Run Anyway``` button. For other antiviruses, add the ```.exe``` to the exclusion or white list for the executable to lauch properly.

If the user is comfortable building the ```.exe``` themselves, it can be done with ```pyinstaller```. [It](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/) can be installed with the following bash command:
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

After navigating to the directory with ```tkinter_main.py```, run the following bash command to build the ```.exe```:
```bash
pyinstaller -F tkinter_main.py
```
