# CP2106-Orbital-Falcon
Falcon

# Installation Instructions
The [GUI](https://github.com/Kurokishi592/Falcon/blob/main/Frontend/Tkinter/tkinter_main.py) relies on Python's Tkinter dependency. Tkinter comes preinstalled with any [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version.

# Runtime Instructions
To run the GUI, run the Python file. This can be done through the terminal, after navigating to the folder that the file is located in:
```bash
python tkinter_main.py
```

Otherwise, ```tkinter_main.exe``` [(link)](https://github.com/Kurokishi592/Falcon/blob/main/Frontend/Tkinter/dist/tkinter_main.exe) can be run. However, as the application has not been signed by any antivirus companies, the active antivirus (Windows Defender or otherwise) is likely to produce a [malware warning](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62095008/i-am-not-allowed-to-run-a-python-executable-on-other-pcs). If using Windows Defender, press on the ```More info``` button, and then the ```Run Anyway``` button. For other antiviruses, add the ```.exe``` to the exclusion or white list for the executable to lauch properly.
